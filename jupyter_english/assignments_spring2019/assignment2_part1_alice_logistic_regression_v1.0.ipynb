The interesting fact is that most of the elements of our matrix are zeros. If we count non-zero elements, then it will be about 1.8 million, i.е. slightly more than 10% of all matrix elements. Such a matrix, where most elements are zeros, is called sparse, and the ratio between the number of zero elements and the total number of elements is called the sparseness of the matrix.\n",

        "The quality of the model has decreased significantly. We added a feature that definitely seemed useful to us, but its usage only worsened the model. Why did it happen?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important detour #2: is it necessary to scale features?\n",
        "\n",
        "Here we give an intuitive reasoning (a rigorous mathematical justification for one or another aspect in linear models you can easily find on the internet). Consider the features more closely: those of them that correspond to the number of visits to a particular web-site per session vary from 0 to 10. The feature `start_month` has a completely different range: from 201301 to 201412, this means the contribution of this variable is significantly greater than the others. It would seem that problem can be avoided if we put less weight in a linear combination of attributes in this case, but in our case logistic regression with regularization is used (by default, this parameter is `C = 1`), which penalizes the model the stronger the greater its weights are. Therefore, for linear methods with regularization, it is recommended to convert features to the same scale (you can read more about the regularization, for example, [here](https://habrahabr.ru/company/ods/blog/322076/)).\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to do this is standardization: for each observation you need to subtract the average value of the feature and divide this difference by the standard deviation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ x^{*}_{i} = \\dfrac{x_{i} - \\mu_x}{\\sigma_x}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The following practical tips can be given:\n",
        "- It is recommended to scale features if they have essentially different ranges or different units of measurement (for example, the country's population is indicated in units, and the country's GNP in trillions)\n",
        "- Scale features if you do not have a reason/expert opinion to give a greater weight to any of them\n",
